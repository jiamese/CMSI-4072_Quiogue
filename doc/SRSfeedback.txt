Documentation Feedback ~ Deliverable #2
Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths:
      Clear architectural listing across mobile, web, backend, and
         infrastructure.
      Subsystems (auth, deals, claims, referrals, storage) are
         distinguishable.
   Suggestions:
      Components appear across PRD and TRD rather than together in a
         single, explicit “component breakdown” section.
      A numbered, hierarchical component list would strengthen traceability.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Many requirements are written in clear “shall”/explicit functional
         form.
      Covers all major user roles comprehensively (brand manager, app
         user).
      API behaviors are fully specified.
   Suggestions:
      Requirements are distributed, not collected into a single
         functional section.
      Some requirements remain at user-story level rather than
         testable statements.
      Missing error-handling requirements (what happens when uploads
         fail, invalid OTP, proof rejects, expired deals).
      No explicit system constraints about limits (max claims, max
         image size, expected data validation rules).
      Some UX-focused features (animations, countdown) are described
         but not expressed as testable functional requirements.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Mentions scaling tools (S3, CDN, async backend).
      System architecture implies performance capacity.
      Some implicit performance expectations: fast feed loading,
         rapid OTP flow, countdown accuracy.
   Suggestions:
      Add explicit timing constraints: API response times, image
         processing times, push/SMS delivery expectations.
      Add efficiency constraints for mobile device performance.
      Add data-volume and scaling expectations.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Explicit technologies used for each layer.
      Clear identification of required third-party services (Twilio,
         AWS, Vercel).
      Identifies iOS app environment.
   Suggestions:
      Add minimum device specifications and OS versions.
      Add staging and deployment environment requirements.
      Define browser support matrix precisely.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown               0.9/1
   Functional Requirements           3.6/4
   Performance Requirements          1.9/2
   Environment Requirements          0.8/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                          7.2/8
   Preliminary Schedule              2.0/2   [Freebee]
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   9.2/10 = 92% which is an A-minus


OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
You've met most of the desired measurements for this deliverable.  Your SRS
is very well done but could benefit from at least incorporating a few of
the suggestions to make it even more complete, such as: Consolidating all
functional requirements into a single numbered SRS style section; adding
failure mode requirements and explicitly state validations; and adding
preconditions/postconditions for core flows (claiming, uploading, approving).

Nice work on this deliverable ~ keep up the good work!
