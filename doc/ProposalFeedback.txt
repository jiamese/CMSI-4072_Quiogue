=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description:
      Not done as specified.  No document for this deliverable.

   Justification:
      Not done as specified.  No document for this deliverable.

Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      Your slides are REALLY nice!  You did a great job on this part of the
      project.  I like the way you vary the backgrounds, your graphics are
      good, there is the 'right amount' of text on the slides, and I like
      the animations ~ they add without distracting.  You also cover all of
      the important points well, and the audience really understands what
      the application is about and why it would be useful.  You also give a
      good rationalization for why doing this project is important for the
      target group.  Very nice work here.

   Video:
      Your video is great also.  Very professional looking and sounding.
      The animations on the slides really shine here and your voice is nice
      and clear.  You obviously have rehearsed what you will say so there is
      very little lag in the presentation.  It does sound a bit like you are
      reading from a script, so that is something you could focus on in the
      next presentation ~ try to do more from your head knowledge and make
      it less like you're reading.  I know that when you're recording it is
      a tendency to have a document that you can read from, but pretend you
      are in front of a live audience.

Summary:
--------

Nice jobe except for the document part. :(
Three out of Five points for this deliverable.
